- [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony). The dll is included with the release zip for convenience.

# Installation
- Extract the release to the Volcanoids mod folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Volcanoid\Volcanoids\Mods`) so `Recipe-Available-Input-Count.dll` is placed like this: `%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Volcanoid\Volcanoids\Mods\Recipe-Available-Input-Count.dll`.

# Un-installation
- Just remove the dll from `%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Volcanoid\Volcanoids\Mods`.
